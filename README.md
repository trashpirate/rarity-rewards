## About
This repo contains a starter kit template for developing and testing smart contracts with [Chainlink Functions](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/). It includes a basic `FunctionsConsumer` contract and a `FunctionsRouterMock` contract to locally test send and fulfill requests. The repo also includes the [functions-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/functions-toolkit) to simulate and interact with the Chainlink oracle. Scripts to spin up a local chainlink test network is also included.

## Installation

### Install dependencies
```bash
$ make install
```

## Usage
Before running any commands, create a .env file and add the following environment variables (see .env.example):

```bash
# network configs
RPC_LOCALHOST="http://127.0.0.1:8545"

# ethereum nework
RPC_TEST=<rpc url>
RPC_MAIN=<rpc url>
ETHERSCAN_KEY=<api key>

# accounts to deploy/interact with contracts
ACCOUNT_NAME="account name"
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="account address"
```

Update chain ids in the `HelperConfig.s.sol` file for the chain you want to configure:

- Ethereum: 1 | Sepolia: 11155111 
- Base: 8453 | Base sepolia: 84532
- Bsc: 56 | Bsc Testnet: 97

Paste Javascript source code for chainlink functions execution into the `source.js` file.

### Run tests
```bash
$ forge test
```

### Deploy contract on testnet
```bash
$ make deploy-testnet
```

### Deploy contract on mainnet
```bash
$ make deploy-mainnet
```

## Deployments

### Testnet
https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xee54de507ab45659f7aed9f2bbb624c6abcfe744#code

### Mainnet

## Chainlink Functions Simulations

1. Paste javascript source code for chainlink functions execution into the `source.js` file

2. Run the following command to simulate the chainlink functions execution:
```bash
$ make simulate-response ARGS="arg1 arg2 ..."
```
For example try `make simulate-response ARGS="ipfs://bafybeieokkbwo2hp3eqkfa5chypmevxjii275icwxnuc7dmuexi3qsuvu4/5 Color"`

## Run Local Chainlink Functions Testnet

**__Note: This setup is only works with `shanghai` EVM version or older!__**

1. Setup your environment variables (secrets) by creating a `.env.enc` file and running:

```bash
# set password to encrypt secrets (or create a new env.enc file)
$ npx env-enc set-pw

# set secrets by following the prompts; not that at least you need to set PRIVATE_KEY to run the testnet
$ npx env-enc set
```

2. Start the local testnet by running:

```bash
$ make start-local-network
```

3. Deploy the contracts to the local testnet:

```bash
$ make deploy-local
```

4. Use the `Interactions.s.sol` script to perform interactions with the `FunctionsConsumer` contract. Here are some shortcuts:

- Send a request to the `FunctionsConsumer` contract:
    ```bash
    $ make send-request
    ```
- Read the response from the `FunctionsConsumer` contract (wait a few seconds after you sent the request for it to fulfill):
    ```bash
    $ make get-response
    ```
