## About
This repo contains the smart contracts allowing users to claim monthly (or any other interval) rewards. The claiming is token gated and based on NFT rarity that are fetched through [Chainlink Functions](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/). For each month, the owner can deposit the total reward amount and define the start date of the claiming period. The users can claim their share of the reward by calling the `claim()` function, which will transfer their share to their wallet.

## Installation

### Install dependencies
```bash
$ make install
```

## Usage
Before running any commands, create a .env file and add the following environment variables (see .env.example):

```bash
# network configs
RPC_LOCALHOST="http://127.0.0.1:8545"

# ethereum nework
RPC_TEST=<rpc url>
RPC_MAIN=<rpc url>
ETHERSCAN_KEY=<api key>

# accounts to deploy/interact with contracts
ACCOUNT_NAME="account name"
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="account address"
```

Update chain ids in the `HelperConfig.s.sol` file for the chain you want to configure:

- Ethereum: 1 | Sepolia: 11155111 
- Base: 8453 | Base sepolia: 84532
- Bsc: 56 | Bsc Testnet: 97

The source code for the chainlink functions execution can be found the `source.js` file.

### Run tests
```bash
$ forge test
```

### Deploy contract on testnet
```bash
$ make deploy-testnet
```

### Deploy contract on mainnet
```bash
$ make deploy-mainnet
```

## Deployments

### Testnet

**ERC20 Contract:** https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xE9e5d3F02E91B8d3bc74Cf7cc27d6F13bdfc0BB6#code

**ERC721 Contract:**  https://sepolia.basescan.org/token/0x77b6d8decfc2dfedb53be9fa527d7939af0e592c#code

**RarityRewards Contract:** https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x32De94416278dc7D0a32034EAf3Cb7243a6048E1#code


### Mainnet

**ERC20 Contract:** https://basescan.org/token/0x803b629c339941e2b77d2dc499dac9e1fd9eac66#code

**ERC721 Contract:**  https://basescan.org/address/0xE9e5d3F02E91B8d3bc74Cf7cc27d6F13bdfc0BB6#code

**RarityRewards Contract:** https://basescan.org/address/0x47ad28668b541cd0de8eb11e3090fb37e69f8a60#code



## Chainlink Functions Simulations

1. Paste javascript source code for chainlink functions execution into the `source.js` file

2. Run the following command to simulate the chainlink functions execution:
```bash
$ make simulate-response ARGS="arg1 arg2 ..."
```
For example try `make simulate-response ARGS="ipfs://bafybeieokkbwo2hp3eqkfa5chypmevxjii275icwxnuc7dmuexi3qsuvu4/5 Color"`

## Run Local Chainlink Functions Testnet

**__Note: This setup is only works with `shanghai` EVM version or older!__**

1. Setup your environment variables (secrets) by creating a `.env.enc` file and running:

```bash
# set password to encrypt secrets (or create a new env.enc file)
$ npx env-enc set-pw

# set secrets by following the prompts; not that at least you need to set PRIVATE_KEY to run the testnet
$ npx env-enc set
```

2. Start the local testnet by running:

```bash
$ make start-local-network
```

3. Deploy the contracts to the local testnet:

```bash
$ make deploy-local
```

4. Use the `Interactions.s.sol` script to perform interactions with the `FunctionsConsumer` contract. Here are some shortcuts:

- Send a request to the `FunctionsConsumer` contract:
    ```bash
    $ make send-request
    ```
- Read the response from the `FunctionsConsumer` contract (wait a few seconds after you sent the request for it to fulfill):
    ```bash
    $ make get-response
    ```
